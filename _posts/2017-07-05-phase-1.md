Phase 1 of GSoC has come to an end, and it has been an awesome one month of work
for Saurav.

First and foremost, DocumentationStyleBear got merged after almost a year of
work. There are still quirks inside it, but it works for now.

Phase 2 deals with creating a `DocBaseClass`, that acts essentially as a
umbrella class for documentation related bears, where common functionality is
abstracted away to this class and the core functionality of the bear is left
upon the user to implement.

Then after the `DocBaseClass` is ready, its time to port the DocumentationStyleBear
to the new framework.

As for the quirks of `DocumentationStyleBear` itself, there are some bugs to be fixed
[#4029], [#1856], [#4200]
