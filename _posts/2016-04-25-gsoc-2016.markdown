So, I am participating in GSoC 2016 with
[coala](http://coala-analyzer.org)!

My proect is based on language independent documentation extraction,
which will involve parsing embedded documentation within code
and separate them into description, parameters and return values
(even doctests!).

After this is done for several languages(Python, C, C++, Java, PHP),
I will implement the following as the functionality of a bear:

* Documentation Style checking as specified by the user.
* Providing aesthetic and grammar fixes.
* Re-formats the documentation (indentation and spacing)
