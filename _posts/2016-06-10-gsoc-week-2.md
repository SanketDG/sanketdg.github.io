Hello,

This is Week 2 of my Google Summer of Code project. In this week, I will
talk about __why documentation is important__ and show you a simple
__bear__ that capitalizes every uncapitalized sentence. (I know!, right?)

When we talk about documentation in a codebase, we generally mean
documentation of objects, i.e. of classes and functions. This helps
future hackers to get started easily with the codebase.
The general convention is to give a brief explanation of the object,
describe the parameters it takes and what it returns. Does this work?

Generally, yes. Most projects do this, and it should work. But the
right question to ask, __"Is it for humans?"__

This is why hand-written documentation is important. I personally
think a right-mix of generated API documentation and hand crafted
documentation works well. This is what we do at [coala]!

The bear I wanted to talk about doesn't do much
right now, but the key takeaway was that I was able to successfully
parse the documentation, analyze and manipulate each section, and
assemble back the documentation. I have recorded a small asciinema
to demonstrate this:
