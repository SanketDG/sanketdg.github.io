So this year, I am mentoring [Saurav] for the gsoc project, [Documentation
Extraction and Parsing], which basically continues the work from my last year's
project.

Last year's project consisted of revamping the documentation extraction API and
creating a language-independent class that parses documentation.

A bear was also planned, but it never got merged because of some regressions.

Saurav's work is to first get a working [DocumenatationStyleBear] merged. By
working, it means it should work as intended on the main coala repos. For
keeping it simple, only Python is being supported right now.

[Niklas] has been a lot of help. I can't begin to say how he has been very
welcoming to both of us, and also has familiarized himself with the
documentation parsing codebase in a few days despite being a few days, and has
done a lot of code reviews.

I hope, with Saurav's commitment and Niklas' guidance, we can get the
documentation extraction and parsing working as a proof of concept for atleast
two languages.
